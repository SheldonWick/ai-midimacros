# Sample Configurations

This folder holds YAML bundles used when testing the config compiler and runtime loader.

- `sample.yaml` â€“ minimal demo showing global defaults, a single device with one page, and a macro reference.

As features grow we can add additional files that exercise advanced scenarios (multi-page layouts, scripts, overlays, etc.).
