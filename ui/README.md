# UI Shell

This directory will contain the Qt/QML application responsible for the visual console, configuration editors, and assistant panel.

Planned substructure:
- `src/` – C++/Rust bridge code and Qt application entry point.
- `qml/` – QML components for virtual console, device browser, and overlays.
- `assets/` – icons, themes, fonts.

Scaffolding will be added once the runtime service API stabilizes.
