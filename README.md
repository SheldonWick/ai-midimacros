# ai-midimacros

Repository scaffold for the next-generation macro workstation. Structure will evolve as we implement the runtime engine, UI shell, and tooling.

## Layout
- `runtime/` – Rust core engine and services.
- `ui/` – Desktop UI (Qt/QML) project files.
- `tools/` – CLI utilities such as config validators, cache builders, migration scripts.
- `config/` – Sample configuration bundles used during development/testing.
- `docs/` – Design and planning documents.

Stay tuned as we flesh out each component step by step.
